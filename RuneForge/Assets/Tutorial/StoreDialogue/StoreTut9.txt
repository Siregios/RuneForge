[RPort:Customer1, RName:Verrona]

Hello Minamo, hello Alex, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm doing splendid, thanks for asking.

[RPort:Fairy, RName:Minamo]

Glad to hear it! What can we help you with today?

[RPort:Customer1, RName:Verrona]

I've just been given a very important task from the Mage's Guild. They want me to clear out a nearby dungeon that's become overrun with powerful wraiths.

[RPort:Fairy, RName:Minamo]

Whoa, that sounds scary!

[RPort:Customer1, RName:Verrona]

It would be, if I didn't have the right tools for the job, which is why I'm here.

I'm going to need an enchanted weapon, but I'm going to need it master crafted.

[RPort:Fairy, RName:Minamo]

Master crafted? Wow, we haven't gotten an order like that in a while.

[RPort:Customer1, RName:Verrona]

Can you do it?

[RPort:Fairy, RName:Minamo]

Of course! Alex and I can get it done for you no problem!

[RPort:Customer1, RName:Verrona]

You and Alex? Are you sure Alex could make a master craft item? No offense Alex, I've just never seen your work before, and a master craft isn't exactly something anyone can do.

[RPort:Fairy, RName:Minamo]

No worries Verrona! I've seen Alex work before, you're in good hands!

[RPort:Customer1, RName:Verrona]

Ok Minamo, I trust you.
