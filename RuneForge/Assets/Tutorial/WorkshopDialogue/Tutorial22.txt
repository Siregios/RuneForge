How's your progress Alex?

Nice work! You definitely put a lot of hard work into these.

I have one more favor to ask.

Could you please make me a fire rune? We're all out, and I always like to have at least one in stock.

This will be easy! Some more golems have brought in a cauldron so we can make a rune with this.

Let's click on the cauldron to start!
