(Sorting Tutorial)

Your golems are helping you assemble the materials needed to craft, but they need a little help getting what they need.

Golems will appear with an object they desire. Drag the object from the shelf to the golem before they get upset and run off. They aren't always the most patient.

You get points for every correct object you give to the golems in the alloted time.

(Tracer Tutorial)

Crafting magical items requires a quick and precise hand to carve out the magical symbols.

You will get points by pointing the mouse towards the correct spot on the object that you are carving.
