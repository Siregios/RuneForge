Runeforge is a 2D store management game mixed with fun-filled minigames. As the main character, you craft runes and manage your store for your mother. Do you have what it takes to become a master runesmith? Play and find out!

This game was made in Unity with C# and was for our Senior Capstone Project at UCI. We were given two quarters (around a little more than 20 weeks) to complete a polished game of our choice.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to play Runeforge is to download it from the following link.

https://pgtruong.itch.io/runeforge

Otherwise, you will need to open our game in Unity 5.5.2f1 and build it maunally from there. The Windows Operating System is preferred as we built most code for Windows, and did not do as much bug testing for Mac builds, but the project should be able to build for Mac as well.

## Built With
Unity 5.5.2f1
